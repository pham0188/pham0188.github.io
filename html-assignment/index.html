            <h1>About me</h1>
        
            <p><h3><strong><em>Hello! Nice to meet you!</em></strong></h3></p>

This is my first time studying abroad, so I miss home a lot. Currently, my mom is helping take care of my two beloved cats: one is a British short-haired cat, and the other is a Siberian cat.</p>

        
        
            <p>As mentioned above, I have a strong passion for design. That's why I chose the Interactive Media Design program at <abbr title="Algonquin College">AC</abbr> because it offers a wide range of courses in various fields such as Photography, Graphic Design, UI/UX Design,... I think I will explore the role of a <em><mark>UX designer</mark></em> in the future. Why? Because I find this position really cool!</p>
