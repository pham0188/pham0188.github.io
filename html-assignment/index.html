            <h2>About me</h2>
        
            <h3><strong>Hello! Nice to meet you!</strong></h3>
            
            <p>My full name is <em>Thi Ngan Giang Pham</em>, but you can also call me <em>Grace</em>. I'm Vietnamese. I was born on 21<sup>st</sup> September, 2001.</p>

            <em>(This is my first photo in Canada)</em>

            <p>I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Languages; however, I want to pursue my passion for design. Therefore, I decided to move to Canada for my study. This is my first time studying abroad, so I miss home a lot. Currently, my mom is helping take care of my two beloved cats: one is a British short-haired cat, and the other is a Siberian cat.</p>

            <h2>My dream</h2>
            <p>As mentioned above, I have a strong passion for design. That's why I chose the Interactive Media Design program at <abbr title="Algonquin College">AC</abbr> because it offers a wide range of courses in various fields such as Photography, Graphic Design, UI/UX Design,... I think I will explore the role of a <em>UX designer</em> in the future. Why? Because I find this position really cool!</p>

            <p>However, my coding skill is still weak, and I always feel very self-conscious about myself. I will try my best to improve it. There is a saying that I always keep it in mind to motivate myself:</p>
